### 1. Modules

Declare a compilation context for a set of components. A module can associate related code such as services to form functions units. Just like javascript modules, NgModules can export functionality and also import it from other modules.

### 2. Components

They are logic exported as a class that handles functionality and data for your templates.

### 3. Decorators

Are functions that modify javascript classes. They have specific metadata, so the system knows what those classes mean and how they should work.

### 4. Directives

They provide logic and connect that data to your template.

### 5. Event Binding

They respond to users input by updating your application data.

### 6. Property Binding

They interpolate values from your app to the HTML.

### 7. Two-way data Binding

It means that changes in the DOM such as user choices are also reflected in your program data.

### 8. Services

They handle data and logic that will be shared all around your app. They are injectable.

### 9. Dependency Injection

It let you keep your components lean and efficient.

### 10. Routing

The routing is basically in charge of giving access to other components to the users. They can provide lazy-loading and we can manage Guards to make sure the user can navigate to that specific page.

### 11. Lazy Loading

Is basically loading our components on demand (only when we need them).

### 12. Rxjs

Is a library for reacting programming using observables to make it easier to compose asynchronous code. It provides better performance, better modularity and better debugging.

### 13. NgRx

Is an stage management library. When the app grows in size and complexity the stage management becomes harder.
